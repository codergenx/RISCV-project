# 1D-FFT
The 1D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an efficient algorithm to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence, reducing the complexity from O(NÂ²) to O(N log N). It is widely used in signal processing, communications, and scientific computing to analyze the frequency components of signals.
